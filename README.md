# Capstone-Project--Santander-Bank
As part of my MS in Business Analytics program, me and two other classmates worked with Santander Bank to analyze their SBA loan data. We were tasked with creating a model to predict loan approval amounts for small businesses. In this project we used Microsoft Office, Python Pandas, and SPSS. The model was done in SPSS which I didn't contribute to. 

Also not all the code in this repository is mine *****.
